      <p class="bio__content">
        I was raised in Tewksbury, a town about 20 miles from Boston, MA. I
        live in Kentucky and enjoy the beauty of the arts and parks of greater
        Cincinnati.
      </p>
      <h2 class="bio__subheader">Academic</h2>
      <p class="bio__content">
        I earned my PhD in Scientific Computing and Computational Mathematics
        from Stanford University in 2004. My research interests include
        recruitment and retention of STEM majors as well as empirical software
        engineering.
      </p>
      <p class="bio__content">
        I enjoy teaching programming classes and meeting students when they
        are first starting their studies here at NKU, and also enjoy teaching
        graduate classes that critically examine evidence-based practices in
        software engineering. I worked in industry for almost 20 years and
        enjoy sharing my successes, and failures, with students as a
        motivation for learning and thinking critically.
      </p>
      <p class="bio__content">
        I am the faculty advisor for the Women In Informatics group and
        currently serve as co-chair for National Council for Women In
        Technology’s Academic Alliance. I am also co-editor of ACM’s SIGCSE
        Bulletin.
